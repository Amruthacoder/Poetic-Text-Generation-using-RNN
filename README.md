Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used for text generation tasks, such as chatbot responses, poetry, and story generation. They process sequential data by maintaining a memory of previous inputs, making them suitable for natural language tasks.


In this notebook i have created a RNN model using LSTM model. In this case training an RNN on Shakespeareâ€™s text to generate new sentences in his writing style.
